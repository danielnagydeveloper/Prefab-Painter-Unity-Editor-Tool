# Prefab-Painter-Unity-Editor-Tool
Prefab Painter is a Unity Editor extension that allows designers and environment artists to quickly place prefabs directly inside the Scene view. It provides brush-based painting, single placement, erase mode, and several level-design-friendly utilities.

Features
Painting Modes

Single Mode — place exactly one prefab per click

Brush Mode — distribute multiple prefabs inside a circular brush area

Erase Mode — removes previously painted objects inside the brush radius



Placement Controls

Paint on Drag — continuously paint while moving the mouse

Surface alignment — rotate objects to match the hit normal

Random scale / random rotation — natural variation for vegetation, rocks, etc.

Surface offset — slightly raise objects above the terrain



Grid Snapping

Snap prefab placement to a configurable XZ grid
Useful for cities, modular assets, or architectural environments.



Layer Filtering

Raycast only against a target layer (e.g., Terrain)

Avoids painting on unwanted colliders



Spawn Avoidance

Prevents placing a prefab too close to an existing one

Keeps spacing clean, avoids intersecting objects



Hotkeys

S → Single Mode

B → Brush Mode

E → Erase Mode

Undo Support

All actions support Unity Undo (Ctrl + Z )
